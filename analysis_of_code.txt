1) Importing necessary libraries:

openpiv: This is a library for performing Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis.
os: Operating System specific module, used for interacting with the file system.
numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for numerical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for Python, used for visualization.
glob: Module for Unix style pathname pattern expansion, used for finding files matching a specified pattern.
imageio: Library for reading and writing a wide range of image data, used for image I/O operations.
importlib_resources: Module for accessing resources inside packages, used for file path manipulation.
pathlib: Module providing an object-oriented interface for working with file paths.

2) Setting up file paths:

importlib_resources.files('openpiv'): Retrieves the path to the 'openpiv' package.
path / 'data/test2/': Appends the 'data/test2/' path to the obtained package path.
os.chdir(path_fig): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.

3) Reading files in the directory:

os.listdir(): Lists all files and directories in the current working directory.
List comprehension [f for f in os.listdir() if os.path.isfile(f)]: Filters out only the files from the list of directory contents.

4) Getting the number of files:

np.size(files): Returns the number of files in the list obtained in the previous step.

5) Looping through image pairs and performing PIV analysis:

Iterates through each file in the list of files.
Reads consecutive image pairs (frame_a and frame_b) using tools.imread().

6) Defining parameters for PIV analysis:

winsize, searchsize, overlap, dt: Parameters required for PIV analysis, representing window size, search area size, overlap size, and time interval between frames, respectively.

7) Performing PIV analysis:

pyprocess.extended_search_area_piv(): Performs PIV analysis on the consecutive frames, returning velocity components (u0, v0) and signal-to-noise ratio (sig2noise).

8) Post-processing:

validation.sig2noise_val(): Generates an invalid mask based on the signal-to-noise ratio.
filters.replace_outliers(): Filters out outliers in velocity components based on the invalid mask.
9) Scaling and transforming coordinates:

scaling.uniform(): Scales velocity and coordinate data using a scaling factor.
tools.transform_coordinates(): Transforms the coordinates and velocity components.

10) Saving results and displaying vector fields:

tools.save(): Saves the processed data into a text file.
tools.display_vector_field(): Visualizes the velocity vector field overlaid on an image.

11) Exiting the script:

exit(): Terminates the Python script execution.


Each step of the code contributes to the process of reading images, analyzing them using PIV techniques, and visualizing the velocity fields.
